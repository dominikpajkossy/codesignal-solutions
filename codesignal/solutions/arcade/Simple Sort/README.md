To understand how efficient the built-in Python sorting function is, you decided to implement your own simple sorting algorithm and compare its speed to the speed of the Python sorting. Write a function that, given an array of integers arr, sorts its elements in ascending order.
Hint: with Python it's possible to swap several elements in a single line. To solve the task, use this knowledge to fill in both of the blanks (...).
Example
For arr = [2, 4, 1, 5], the output should be
solution(arr) = [1, 2, 4, 5].
Input/Output


[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py)


[memory limit] 1 GB


[input] array.integer arr
Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 500,
-105 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105.


[output] array.integer
The given array with elements sorted in ascending order.


[Python 2] Syntax Tips
# Prints help message to the console
# Returns a string
def helloWorld(name):
    print "This prints to the console when you Run Tests"
    return "Hello, " + name
